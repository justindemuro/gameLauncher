# gameLauncher

Automate repetitive tasks with a snarky launcher.

gameLauncher is an AutoHotKey script developed to perform simple tasks that are time consuming when you just want to play a game on Steam Big Picture Mode or RetroArch. It's main function is to provide a seamless way to get in and out of these applications, handling the tedious task of switching audio outputs back and forth in the Windows GUI, providing audio cues, all while having a bit of a snarky "personality" coded into it for added fun.

Currently this application has only been tested on one PC running Windows 7. I am working on making the entire project and its dependencies portable so it may be plopped into any directory on any Windows PC and run straight from there with little user configuration.

Future implementations will include more user customization as well as extensibility for other game platforms, via an INI file, and eventually GUI settings.

For now it's just a simple program that works. Updates are ongoing. Feature requests will be considered.
